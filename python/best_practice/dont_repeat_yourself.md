# Don't repeat yourself (or others): Python Modules

**Based on Lecture Materials By: Milad Fatenejad, Katy Huff, and Paul Wilson**

In this lecture we shift gears slightly.  The best practices of "Write Code
for People" continue to be important, but we'll start to place more emphasis
on the best practices of "Don't Repeat Yourself", and its twin practice of
"Don't Repeat Others".

We've already seen the importance of loops as a way to avoid repeating
yourself.  We've also already discussed the use of functions.  In this lesson,
we'll explore how to use other people's modules, and how to package pieces of
your code together into reusable modules.

## Reminder: Pasting into IPython

To paste text from another application (i.e. these lecture notes) into
IPython :

1.  select text from the website
2.  copy with <kbd>cntl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> (or <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> on Mac OSX)
3.  unfortunately pasting depends on your operating system and ssh program:

#### Windows

##### Git Bash

When in the IPython interpreter, the easiest way to paste is with the right
mouse button over the window, choosing "Paste".

##### Putty
Click with the right mouse button over the window.

#### Mac OSX
Press <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>.

#### Linux
Click with the right mouse button over the window and then "Paste".

The code should paste and execute in IPython.

In general, for multi-line pasting, you should use the `%cpaste` feature of IPython.

# Python Modules

Python has a lot of useful data type and functions built into the language, some of which you have already seen. For a full list, you can type `dir(__builtins__)`. However, there are even more functions stored in modules. An example is the sine function, which is stored in the math module. In order to access mathematical functions, like `sin`, we need to `import` the math module. Let's take a look at a simple example:

```python

print sin(3) # Error! Python doesn't know what sin is...yet

import math # Import the math module
math.sin(3)

print dir(math) # See a list of everything in the math module

help(math) # Get help information for the math module
```

It is not very difficult to use modules - you just have to know the module name and import it. There are a few variations on the import statement that can be used to make your life easier. Let's take a look at an example:

```python

from math import *  # import everything from math into the global namespace (A BAD IDEA IN GENERAL)
print sin(3)        # notice that we don't need to type math.sin anymore
print tan(3)        # the tangent function was also in math, so we can use that too
```

```python
reset # Clear everything from IPython

from math import sin  # Import just sin from the math module. This is a good idea.
print sin(3)          # We can use sin because we just imported it
print tan(3)          # Error: We only imported sin - not tan
```

```python
reset                 # Clear everything
import math as m      # Same as import math, except we are renaming the module m
print m.sin(3)        # This is really handy if you have module names that are long
```

If you intend to use python in your workflow, it is a good idea to skim the standard library documentation at the main Python documentation site, [docs.python.org](http://docs.python.org) to get a general idea of the capabilities of python "out of the box".

Let's take a look at a nice docstring for a [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrame. Pandas is a Python data analysis toolkit, and the DataFrame is its main data type. It's equivalent to a single rectangular dataset which you'd see in many other statistical packages. For more on pandas, check out this [tutorial](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html).

```python
import pandas
pandas.DataFrame?

Type:            type
String form:     <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
File:            //anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pandas/core/frame.py
Init definition: pandas.DataFrame(self, data=None, index=None, columns=None, dtype=None, copy=False)
Docstring:
Two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data
structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). Arithmetic operations
align on both row and column labels. Can be thought of as a dict-like
container for Series objects. The primary pandas data structure

    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : numpy ndarray (structured or homogeneous), dict, or DataFrame
        Dict can contain Series, arrays, constants, or list-like objects
    index : Index or array-like
        Index to use for resulting frame. Will default to np.arange(n) if
        no indexing information part of input data and no index provided
    columns : Index or array-like
        Column labels to use for resulting frame. Will default to
        np.arange(n) if no column labels are provided
    dtype : dtype, default None
        Data type to force, otherwise infer
    copy : boolean, default False
        Copy data from inputs. Only affects DataFrame / 2d ndarray input

    Examples
    --------
    >>> d = {'col1': ts1, 'col2': ts2}
    >>> df = DataFrame(data=d, index=index)
    >>> df2 = DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 5))
    >>> df3 = DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 5),
    ...                 columns=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'])

    See also
    --------
    DataFrame.from_records : constructor from tuples, also record arrays
    DataFrame.from_dict : from dicts of Series, arrays, or dicts
    DataFrame.from_csv : from CSV files
    DataFrame.from_items : from sequence of (key, value) pairs
    pandas.read_csv, pandas.read_table, pandas.read_clipboard
    """

```

We see a nice docstring seperating into several sections. A short description of the function is given, then all the input parameters are listed, then the outputs, there are some notes and examples. 
Please note the docstring is longer than the code. And there are few comments in the actual code.

![Exercise](pics/exercise.jpg) **Short exercise: Learn about sys**

In the script we wrote to convert text files to CSV, we used the `sys` module.  Use the IPython interpreter to learn more about the `sys` module and what it does.  What is `sys.argv` and why did we only use the last n-1 elements? What is `sys.stdout`?

* * * *

## The python CSV Module

In the last lecture, we wrote code to write out some structured information in
a CSV formatted file.  In that case, we enclosed every element of the table in
quotes.  For most tools that read CSV files, this causes those elements to
always be interpretted a strings.  However, we had many numerical entries and
may want those to be recorded as numbers.

There are three ways to do this:
1. Rewrite our functions to only enclose the string elements in quotation
   marks for this particular data set.  Straightforward, but only useful in
   this particular project.
2. Rewrite our functions to detect which elements are really strings and which
   are not.  Probably quite difficult and error prone.
3. Find a module that does this for us already.  Clearly the best choice!!!

In fact, there is a CSV module already available.

![Exercise](pics/exercise.jpg) **Short Exercise** Use google to search for a `python csv module`.

Instead of having you learn about the CSV module from the documentation and
examples, we'll point you to the most important things:

```
In [25]: import csv
In [26]: dir(csv)
In [27]: help(csv)
In [28]: dir(csv.DictWriter)
In [29]: csv.DictWriter?
```

The truth is that the documentation provided here is probably not enough to
learn it by yourself.  The online documentation is better, and even better are
some examples that you can find online.

We'll start by adding the following to our file:

```python
import csv

csv_writer = csv.DictWriter(sys.stdout, delimiter=',', fieldnames=column_labels)
```

This provides a way to write CSV files from python dictionaries.  More specifically:
* we will write this to the screen using `sys.stdout`
* we will use a comman (',') as the delimiter (Note: we can remove any reference to `csv_separator` now)
* we will use `column_labels` to provide the order in which to write the fields from our data

Now we can replace the two functions we added previously:
* instead of `writeCSVHeader(column_labels,csv_separator)` we have `csv_writer.writeheader()`
* instead of `writeCSVRow(column_labels,data_record,csv_separator)` we have `csv_writer.writerow(data_record)`

So that our script now ends with the following lines:

```python
import csv
csv_writer = csv.DictWriter(sys.stdout, delimiter=',', fieldnames=column_labels)

csv_writer.writeheader()
for data_record in all_data:
    csv_writer.writerow(data_record)
```

![Exercise](pics/exercise.jpg) **Try it now!**

![Exercise](pics/exercise.jpg) **Short Exercise:** Figure out how to change the quoting behavior of the CSV writer and explore different options.  Do any of them put the strings in quotations but not the numbers?

![Exercise](pics/exercise.jpg) **Bonus Exercise:** The CSV module even has a method to write multiple rows: `writerows()`.  Try using it in stead of the loop over `all_data`.

We still need to ensure that the numerical results in our original files are
being treated as numbers.  To do so, immediately before returning our value
from `extractData()` we'll:
* define a list of columns that should be treated as numeric
* if we find one, convert it to a float

```python
    numeric_columns = ("Age","Income","Education","Hours per week")
    if key in numeric_columns and value != "" :
        value = float(value)
```

# Writing Your Own Module

For our set of survey data, we may now be interested in performing
some simple statistical analysis of the results.  For example, we may want to
know the mean value of the `Income` data from all the subjects.

Since we know that taking the mean value of many numbers (and other
statistics) is something we may want to do in many different projects in the
future, let's make a module that contains those functions.  (Note: Most of
these functions are already available in existing modules and it would be best
to use those, but this is a convenient example that everyone probably can
understand equally well.)

Making a new module is as simple as defining functions in a new python file.
Let's call our file `stats.py` and start by adding a function to calculate the
mean.

```python
def mean(vals):
    """Calculate the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers in vals"""
    total = sum(vals)
    length = len(vals)
    return total/length
```

We can now use this module in our original script.

![Exercise](pics/exercise.jpg) **Exercise:**

1. Add some lines to the original script to get a list with only the `Income` data.
2. Use this `mean()` function to calculate the mean of those numbers.

##The General Problem##

![xkcd](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_general_problem.png "I find that when
 someone's taking time to do something right in the present, they're a
 perfectionist with no ability to prioritize, whereas when someone took time
 to do something right in the past, they're a master artisan of great
 foresight.")

From [xkcd](http://www.xkcd.com)
 
Now that you can write your own functions, you too will experience the dilemma
of deciding whether to spend the extra time to make your code more general,
and therefore more easily reused in the future.
